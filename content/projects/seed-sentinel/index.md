## Project Overview
Seed Sentinel is an open-source platform that translates plant signals into actionable insights. By combining affordable soil sensors with an AI botanist, it monitors real-time conditions and compares them to each plant’s needs. This data-driven approach empowers anyone to grow seeds successfully and restore ecosystems—without proprietary barriers.
