## 💻 The Engineer

I’m a **Backend Software Engineer** focused on building efficient, high-performance systems. I specialize in orchestrating data services with **Go**, **Python**, and **TypeScript**, leveraging **FHIR** and **AI** to make sense of data in the complex world of healthcare interoperability.

I enjoy creating the bridge between complex data and real-world utility.

I thrive in honest environments where the mission is clear, communication is direct, and the focus is on solving meaningful problems for real users.

## 🏃 The Person

When I’m not at the keyboard, I’m usually training for my next marathon, tending to my garden, or tinkering with 3D printing and home automation.

I live with my wife, our dog Courage, and a cat named Fluff who supervises all code reviews.
