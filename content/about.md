### My Mindset

> I approach software engineering with a **physicist’s mindset**: deconstruct problems to first principles, understand the constraints, and build the most efficient solution possible.

For me, code that "just works" is the **baseline, not the ceiling**. I am driven by a curiosity that digs deep into the "why" and "how" of every stack to ensure reliability, but I always balance technical optimization with **delivery and business value**.

### Engineering Experience

As a **Backend Engineer**, I combine this deep analytical background with **over seven years** of practical experience building robust, scalable systems. My expertise lies in **Python, Node.js, and Cloud Architecture (AWS/GCP)**, but I am a firm believer in continuous evolution.

Technology moves fast, and I move with it. I am currently expanding my technical depth in **Go, Data Engineering, and AI**, bridging the gap between backend infrastructure and intelligent data systems.

### Mission & Impact

Beyond the code, I am defined by a **relentless drive to make a meaningful impact**. I am not interested in engineering for its own sake; I want to **solve real-world problems**. 

I am seeking to bring my engineering rigor to a **mission-driven organization** where technology is used as a force for good. I want to build solutions that matter alongside a team that values technical excellence, **pragmatic problem solving**, and positive change.
