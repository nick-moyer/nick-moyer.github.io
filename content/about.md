I approach software engineering with a physicist’s mindset: deconstruct every problem to its first principles, understand the constraints, and build the most efficient solution possible. For me, code that "just works" is never the finish line, it's merely the starting point for optimization. I refuse to settle for the status quo, and I am driven by a curiosity that digs deep into the "why" and "how" of every stack to ensure true performance and reliability.

As a Backend Engineer, I combine this deep analytical background with over seven years of practical experience building robust, scalable systems. My expertise lies in Python, Node.js, and Cloud Architecture (AWS/GCP), but I am a firm believer in continuous evolution. Technology moves fast, and I move with it. I am currently expanding my technical depth in Go, Data Engineering, and AI to bridge the gap between backend infrastructure and intelligent data systems.

Beyond the code, I am defined by a relentless drive to make a meaningful impact. I am not interested in engineering for its own sake; I want to solve real-world problems. I am seeking to bring my engineering rigor and optimization mindset to a mission-driven organization where technology is used as a force for good. I want to leave the world better than I found it, building solutions that matter alongside a team that values technical excellence and positive change.
