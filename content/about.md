### The Engineer

I’m a Backend Software Engineer focused on building efficient, high-performance systems. I specialize in handling data in the complex world of healthcare interoperability. I bridge the gap between raw infrastructure and meaningful data utility.

My philosophy is simple: Pragmatism wins. I love architecture that is optimized for speed and stability, ensuring we ship value without over-engineering the solution.

I thrive in honest environments where the mission is clear, communication is direct, and the focus is on solving meaningful problems for real users.

### The Person

**Hi, I'm Nick.**

When I’m not at the keyboard, I’m usually training for my next marathon, tending to my garden or tinkering with 3D printing and home automation.

I live with my wife, our dog Courage, and a cat named Fluff who supervises all code reviews.

#### Currently...
* **Reading:** Quantum Supremacy (Kaku) & The Martian (Weir)
* **Training For:** Milwaukee Marathon (April 2026)
* **Deep Dive:** Go Internals (Runtime, GC, & Scheduler)
