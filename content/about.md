I approach software engineering by breaking problems down to their fundamentals, understanding constraints, and making deliberate tradeoffs. Code that works is expected; what I care about is whether it’s understandable, maintainable, and appropriate for the problem it’s solving.

I tend to dig into the "why" behind systems and tools so I can make better decisions and avoid fragile solutions, but I’m also pragmatic. I value shipping, iteration, and aligning technical choices with business needs rather than optimizing in isolation.

I’m currently deepening my experience with Go, Python, data engineering, and applied AI, with a focus on building reliable backend systems that support real data and real users. I’m especially interested in work that sits at the intersection of infrastructure and data, where design decisions have long-term impact.

I’m looking to contribute to a mission-driven team that values thoughtful engineering, clear communication, and steady progress. I do my best work in environments that care about quality but are honest about constraints, and where technology is used to solve meaningful problems, not just interesting ones.
