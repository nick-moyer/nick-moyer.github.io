# {{< icon "bars" >}} Professional Experience

> [!abstract]+ **Remo Health** | Software Engineer II & III | Oct 2023 - Dec 2025
> **Impact:** Supported clinical operations through intelligent automation and FHIR-standardized architecture.
>
> * **Software Engineer III:** Oct 2024 - Dec 2025
>   * Developed and deployed several Medplum Bots (serverless functions) to automate critical workflows.
>   * Optimized a production-level LLM-agent (Python/LangChain) responsible for summarizing extensive patient EHR records and reducing manual review time for clinicians.
>   * Designed and built secure, resilient services to interact with external APIs. This process automated real-time verification of patient insurance eligibility and enabled synchronization of historical records.
> * **Software Engineer II:** Oct 2023 - Oct 2024
>   * Led the integration of a FHIR server (Medplum) into the core patient pathways application.

> [!abstract]- **Olive AI** | Software Engineer II & I | Aug 2021 - Feb 2023
> **Impact:** Engineered robust data pipelines and secure cloud infrastructure for large-scale healthcare claims processing.
>
> * **Software Engineer III:** Aug 2022 - Feb 2023
>   * Engineered automated workflows to ingest, validate, and manipulate large volumes of PHI (X12 claim data), ensuring data integrity for downstream analytics.
>   * Deployed and managed scalable backend infrastructure using Terraform and AWS, ensuring full HIPAA compliance and security.
> * **Software Engineer II:** Aug 2021 - Aug 2022
>   * Refactored legacy codebases to improve maintainability and performance, implementing rigorous unit testing and documentation standards.

> [!abstract]- **VasoGnosis** | Full-Stack Developer | Sep 2020 – Aug 2021
> **Impact:** Led the development of a 3D medical imaging platform and migrated it to a cloud-native architecture.
>
>  * Developed "VG-Recon," a Django-based platform for analyzing 3D medical images (DICOM/NIFTI). Integrated AI models to automate image processing and diagnostic data extraction.
>  * Managed the migration to cloud-based infrastructure on AWS, implementing CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployment and reduce release cycles.
>  * Built APIs to parse complex medical metadata and integrate with external health organization systems, extending product capabilities.

> [!abstract]- **AWH** | Software Developer | Jul 2018 - Sep 2020
> **Impact:** Delivered high-performance data solutions and technical mentorship across multiple client verticals.
>
>  * Implemented complex SQL modifications to handle data deduplication and improving performance
>  * Managed requirements for multiple simultaneous client projects while mentoring junior developers.
>  * Utilized cloud monitoring tools to diagnose production bottlenecks, ensuring minimal downtime.

> [!abstract]- **AK Steel** | Process Automation Engineer | May 2017 - Jul 2018
> **Impact:** Utilized modeling and PLC automation to optimize industrial production.
>
> * **Process Automation Engineer:** Sep 2017 - Jul 2018
>   * Applied mathematical modeling to industrial process data to optimize steel production efficiency.
> * **Automation Engineering Intern:** May 2017 - Sep 2017
>   * Worked under several senior level engineers to improve level 1 automation controls (ControlLogix/ABB PLCs)
>   * Analyzed level 1 and level 2 automation data. Assisted in a drives upgrade project where I helped with PC configurations and Ethernet control networks
